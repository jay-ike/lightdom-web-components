# lightdom-web-components
This repository's purpose is to illustrate the fact that we can create webcomponents without using the shadow DOM
Also this repository is inspired by this [article](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/11/01/blinded-by-the-light-dom) of [Eric Meyer](https://github.com/meyerweb)

## Structure
- The **date-picker** directory contains the documentation and source code of the datepicker component


## Contribution
